question - Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
Ans:-
By default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
code :-
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal thread:", threading.current_thread().name)

def test_signal():
    print("Caller thread:", threading.current_thread().name)
    User.objects.create(username="testuser")
